yeah.  this is my npc generator.  booyeah




Have you ever wanted a quick NPC generator for a wacky and silly game? Look no further!
This NPC generator is full of wacky and silly traits!  Here's a list of them!
1. You have the names! Some names are normal while others are complete nonsense!
2. You have hair styles!  Explore NPC's with some classic hairstyles like being bald or having a bowl cut! Explore funny hair styles like the super massive and funny hairstyle, the low taper fade!
3. Cant forget the hair color.  Try having hot bubble gum pink hair color.
4. Can't forget skin tone either!  Range from colors like pitch black to neon white!
5. What's funnier than wacky clothing? Regular clothing!  With only six options of clothing this is a total break from the wackiness of the NPC generator!
6. What about some myth races?  This can include humans and even draconians with more!
7. What about some good 'ol characteristics?
8. Can't forget gender.
9. You also have a few different ages.
10.  There is a part of the code, that depending on what age the NPC is, determines if the NPC is given the Senile trait.

The main purpose of this short code NPC generator is to help you get past a mental fog or block and come up with quick and short ideas for NPC's.  This is in no intent of being serious and fancy.  This is meant to be silly and stupid.  I hope you enjoy it and I hope this helps!
